# Viewing Party

This is the [Viewing Party Lite project](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/projects/viewing_party_lite) used for Turing's Backend Module 3.

### About this Project

Viewing Party Lite is an application in which users can explore movie options and create a viewing party event for themselves and other users of the application. This was a paired project that was completed over 5 days. 

After the paired project was completed, students completed individual authentication and authorization challenges. On my own, I refactored the Viewing Party Lite project by updating the registration form to include a password and password confirmation field and securely stored users' passwords upon registration. I also used Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to create user types to restrict or allow certain users (registered users, visitors, or admins) to access specific pages and functions.
